### Generac Power Systems
- Score: 95
- Tier: 1
- Status: Active sequence
- Outreach Start: 2026-01-15
- Revisit: 2026-03-01
- Angle: New CIO/CTO need transformation wins - 6 tools creating context-switching during incidents
- Signals: SRE hiring (Jan 2026) | New CIO 22mo + CTO 20mo | $125M tariff pressure
- Why NOW: New CIO (22mo) + CTO (20mo) need transformation wins. $125M tariff pressure demands consolidation math. SRE hiring shows capacity gap. Budget cycle reset (8mo since deal lost).
- Why NOW Source: ChatAE Jan 2026, Gong May 2025
- Why GRAFANA: 6 overlapping tools (Splunk, Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Azure Monitor x2) = engineers context-switch during incidents. Self-host preference. Champion: "unlocking features we know we want."
- Why GRAFANA Source: ChatAE Jan 2026, Gong May 2025, HG Data
- Why ANYTHING: IoT platform (PowerInsights) scaling faster than team capacity. Device telemetry = high-cardinality metrics. "Net zero for leadership" = need savings math. Data hire tabled.
- Why ANYTHING Source: Gong May 2025 (8mo old)
- Outcome: Tool consolidation ROI (net zero math) + IoT telemetry at scale + capacity gap solved without headcount
- Data Freshness: MEDIUM
- Data Warning: Gong context 8 months old. "End of July" deadline likely passed - revalidate timeline.

### Sweetwater
- Score: 92
- Tier: 1
- Status: Active sequence - FU #2 due
- Outreach Start: 2026-01-13
- Revisit: 2026-02-27
- Angle: Existing k6 customer ($18K ARR) - microservices migration creating complexity Datadog can't handle cheaply
- Signals: Chris Rottinger 130 hrs + pricing (Jan 2026) | Ryand McGuire NetFlow docs (Jan 8) | Calista 151 hrs | Ian reply confirmed Datadog + API Tormentor (Jan 15)
- Why NOW: Microservices migration creating distributed systems complexity. Platform Eng team managing K8s, CI/CD, logging = infrastructure maintenance competes with feature work. Multiple pricing page views = active evaluation.
- Why NOW Source: CSV Jan 2026, ChatAE Jan 2026
- Why GRAFANA: Existing customer ($18K ARR, k6 only) = proven value, expansion not net-new. Datadog confirmed "expensive" + confirmed Datadog for observability (Ian reply Jan 2026). Datadog 2/5 = low switching friction.
- Why GRAFANA Source: CRM + HG Data Jan 2026, Gong Nov 2025, Ian reply Jan 2026
- Why ANYTHING: API Tormentor (in-house load tester) confirms build culture = willing to invest eng hours in custom tooling. Microservices migration = need observability for services they didn't have before.
- Why ANYTHING Source: Ian reply Jan 2026, ChatAE Jan 2026
- Outcome: Engineering hours reclaimed from infrastructure maintenance + platform team productivity on features not tooling + distributed systems visibility
- Data Freshness: HIGH
- New Intel (Jan 20): Ian Gongwer replied - his team (Inbound) doesn't use k6, uses API Tormentor (in-house) + Datadog. Confirms build culture + Datadog displacement opportunity. Thread closed professionally.
- Cold Outbound: Not recommended - 54% org coverage (15/28), no persona gaps, CIO = DNC
- Top Contacts: Chris Rottinger (pricing signal) | Ryand McGuire (Platform Eng Mgr, NetFlow) | Calista Helinski (151 hrs)
- Competitive: Datadog 2/5 (confirmed expensive), API Tormentor (in-house load tester)

- Tier: 1
- Status: Active sequence
- Outreach Start: 2026-01-13
- Revisit: 2026-02-27
- Angle: OSS Loki migration failed after 14 months - Cloud solves operational burden
- Signals: Kamlesh 36 pages (Jan 2026) | Sunil 7 hrs Cloud trial | New team vs 2023 closed-lost
- Why NOW: NEW team evaluating (different people than 2023 closed-lost = no baggage). OSS approach shifted to Cloud trial. Activity within 7 days.
- Why NOW Source: CSV Jan 2026
- Why GRAFANA: OSS Loki migration FAILED after 14 months - still Elasticsearch 5/5. Cloud solves operational burden. Successfully exited Datadog (now 1/5) = proves they CAN migrate.
- Why GRAFANA Source: Gong Nov 2023 (26mo - HG Data Jan 2026 validates Elastic still 5/5)
- Why ANYTHING: HYPOTHESIS (26mo old). Wanted to "go all in" on Grafana stack. 99.5% uptime SLA commitment. Staff SRE hiring = scaling team (current).
- Why ANYTHING Source: Gong Nov 2023 (treat as hypothesis), ChatAE Jan 2026 (SRE hiring current)
- Outcome: SLA compliance (if 99.5% still valid) + Staff SRE time on reliability not infrastructure + Elastic migration unblocked
- Data Freshness: LOW-MEDIUM
- Data Warning: Why ANYTHING quotes 26 months old. HG Data validates technical state (Elastic still 5/5). Score adjusted 88→85.
- Top Contacts: Kamlesh (36 pages research) | Sunil (Cloud trial active)
- Competitive: Elasticsearch 5/5 (stuck), Datadog exited to 1/5

### AbbVie
- Score: 82
- Tier: 1
- Status: Active sequence
- Outreach Start: 2026-01-14
- Revisit: 2026-02-28
- Angle: Champion had budget line item - On-Prem deal paused on firewall, Cloud bypasses blocker
- Signals: Tommie Carter logged in (Jan 13) | Julius Popoola Loki/Alloy research | 5 re:Invent scans (Dec 2025)
- Why NOW: On-Prem deal PAUSED (firewall), not rejected. Champion (Tommie) still active. Julius researching Loki/Alloy. Platform Engineering hiring.
- Why NOW Source: CSV Jan 2026, Gong Feb-Sep 2025
- Why GRAFANA: Champion (Tommie) had budget line item. Quote: "tie all tool sets into single view." Splunk/Cribl for SIEM = Grafana as unified viz layer. 60-user pack previously approved.
- Why GRAFANA Source: Gong Jul-Sep 2025
- Why ANYTHING: "Next two phases is ServiceNow integration and Splunk integration." Incident Command Center with MTTR tracking.
- Why ANYTHING Source: Gong Jul 2025, ChatAE Jan 2026
- Outcome: Single pane across Splunk/ServiceNow + MTTR improvement + firewall blocker bypassed via Cloud
- Data Freshness: MEDIUM
- Data Warning: Gong buyer quotes 4-6 months old. Jeff Ames BURNT - DO NOT CONTACT.
- Top Contacts: Tommie Carter (champion, budget holder) | Julius Popoola (Loki/Alloy research)

- Status: Active - Warm + Cold Outbound
- Outreach Start: 2026-01-20
- Revisit: 2026-03-06
- Angle: Tax season reliability + tool consolidation before Dynatrace locks them in
- Signals: Dynatrace research (Jan 2026) | Tax season T-2 weeks | 6+ tool fragmentation | Feb 2023 outage context
- Why NOW: Actively researching Dynatrace before tax season peak (Jan-Apr). Board-level reliability pressure from Feb 2023 filing season outage. Tax season starts in 2 weeks.
- Why NOW Source: ZoomInfo Jan 2026, ChatAE Jan 2026
- Why GRAFANA: 6+ fragmented tools (AppInsights HIGH, AppDynamics, Datadog, NR, Splunk). Already invested in Prometheus + OTel + k6 (all LOW). AKS at scale with SRE practices. MyBlock microservices = distributed tracing need.
- Why GRAFANA Source: ChatAE Jan 2026, HG Data Jan 2026
- Why ANYTHING: Tax season = 4-month window with majority of annual revenue. Downtime during filing is existential. HYPOTHESIS: $150M cost savings mandate (Fortune 2022 - 4yr stale).
- Why ANYTHING Source: Public, Fortune 2022 (treat cost mandate as hypothesis)
- Outcome: Competitive evaluation before tax season lock-in + tool consolidation + reliability for filing peak
- Data Freshness: MEDIUM
- Data Warning: Cost mandate very stale (2022). Current triggers (Dynatrace research, tax season) are strong.
- Top Contacts: Krishna Kumar (warm, 3hr usage) | Mark Simmons (warm, k6 docs) | 33 cold contacts loaded
- Competitive: Dynatrace (actively researching), AppInsights (incumbent HIGH), AppDynamics, Datadog, New Relic, Splunk

- Signals: Sr Observability Engineer posting (Jan 2026) | Q3 record revenue $1.43B | 2026+ roadmap planning
- Why NOW: $250K deal ON HOLD (not closed-lost). "Starting to think about 2026+ roadmap." Sr Observability Engineer job posting.
- Why NOW Source: Gong Jul-Oct 2025, ChatAE Jan 2026
- Why GRAFANA: $1M Datadog + New Relic spend they explicitly want to exit. Moog/AIOps has "minimal dashboard capability." Quote: "Don't want to get locked into their ecostructure."
- Why GRAFANA Source: Gong Jul-Oct 2025, HG Data Jan 2026
- Why ANYTHING: Tool consolidation mandate. Quote: "Take it to the next level of an enterprise monitoring system." 5+ fragmented tools.
- Why ANYTHING Source: Gong Sep 2025, ChatAE Jan 2026
- Outcome: $1M tool spend reduced + enterprise monitoring standardization + vendor lock-in avoided
- Data Freshness: MEDIUM
- Data Warning: Gong quotes 3-6 months old. Mid-Nov follow-up window passed. 2 champions (Isaac, John) left company.

- Why NOW Source: ChatAE Jan 2026, CSV Jan 2026
- Why GRAFANA: Already Cloud Trial user. k6 usage. 6+ tools fragmented (Datadog, Honeycomb, Prometheus, Splunk). Quote context needed.
- Why GRAFANA Source: CSV Jan 2026, HG Data Jan 2026
- Why ANYTHING: Platform team building observability standards. "Blueprints" approach = want one standard before IDP locks in tooling.
- Why ANYTHING Source: ChatAE Jan 2026

- Status: Warm reply follow-up
- Outreach Start: 2026-01-19
- Revisit: 2026-03-05
- Angle: $250K Datadog renewal in 2 months - Loki for bulk log parsing without duplication
- Signals: Warm reply (Jan 19) | $250K Datadog renewal Mar 26 | "Halved cloud bill" already (Gong Oct 2025)
- Why NOW: $250K Datadog contract renewal March 26, 2026 (~2 months). Evaluating Loki as logging alternative before renewal decision. Already "halved cloud bill" = actively seeking more cost reduction.
- Why NOW Source: Gong Oct 2025, Reply Jan 2026
- Why GRAFANA: Specific Loki use case: "bulk log data, rapid parsing" for edge K8s clusters. K8s standardization complete (HAOS on k3s). Self-hosted Elastic preference = open to OSS-friendly approach.
- Why GRAFANA Source: Gong Oct 2025, ChatAE Oct 2025
- Why ANYTHING: $250K/year observability spend locked in Datadog. Duplication problem: can't separate metrics from logs without paying twice. Needs logging solution that complements, not duplicates, existing stack.
- Why ANYTHING Source: Gong Oct 2025
- Outcome: $250K Datadog cost reduction + bulk log parsing without duplication + edge K8s observability
- Data Freshness: HIGH
- Data Warning: Skeptical prospect ("not a huge opportunity" per AE) - handle carefully
- Top Contacts: Warm reply contact | Edge K8s team
- Competitive: Datadog $250K/yr, self-hosted Elastic

- Signals: 12 daily Cloud logins (Jan 2026) | Intent signal Jan 6 | Sukanya researching AI obs, k6, Alloy
- Why NOW: 12 active Cloud users (daily logins). Intent signal Jan 6: "Actively researching observability products." New CPO (Chai Atreya, June 2025).
- Why NOW Source: CSV + ZoomInfo Jan 2026
- Why GRAFANA: HYPOTHESIS (35mo old). Self-hosted Loki = 73% cost savings (Blog Feb 2023). Churn was BUDGET not product fit (Gong Jan 2024 - 24mo). Current behavior (Cloud research) validates continued interest.
- Why GRAFANA Source: Blog Feb 2023, Gong Jan 2024 (both stale - treat as hypothesis), CSV Jan 2026 (current behavior)
- Why ANYTHING: HYPOTHESIS (35mo old). "Managing LGTM stack in-house" = operational overhead (Blog Feb 2023). Still running Datadog 2/5, New Relic 2/5 (HG Data Jan 2026 - current). CFO lockdown status unknown.

- Why GRAFANA: Already self-hosted Grafana OSS users. Cloud trial = evaluating managed. K8s 5/5, New Relic 2/5 + Datadog 1/5 = light incumbent footprint.
- Why GRAFANA Source: CSV Jan 2026, HG Data Jan 2026
- Why ANYTHING: HYPOTHESIS - Platform team capacity consumed by infrastructure maintenance. Engineering growth outpaced tooling. 15-20M SKUs = high-cardinality metrics.
- Why ANYTHING Source: Hypothesis only - no ChatAE, no Gong

## Critical Learning: Stale Data Rule (Added Jan 20)

- 0-6 months: Current/Recent - use as evidence
- 6-12 months: Aging - note inline
- 12-24 months: Stale - flag for revalidation
- 24+ months: Very stale - treat as HYPOTHESIS, not evidence

Examples:
- CIO 2018 story (8yr) replaced by API Tormentor (Jan 2026) for build culture evidence
- 73% savings (35mo) flagged as hypothesis, not fact
