### Jack Henry & Associates
* Score: 100
* Tier: 1
* Status: Active sequence (cold)
* Outreach Start: 2026-01-15
* Revisit: 2026-03-01
* Angle: Platform team building observability blueprints - need one standard before IDP locks in
* Signals: Enterprise Trial started (Jan 14) | 6 warm leads active | SRE hiring OTel/SLO focus
* Why NOW: Enterprise Trial request (INBOUND). Cloud Trial started Jan 14. SRE hiring with OTel/SLO focus. 6 warm leads active last 30 days. Platform Engineering building IDP = standardization decision imminent.
* Why GRAFANA: 6+ observability tools creating context-switching during incidents (Datadog, Honeycomb, Prometheus, Splunk). Platform team building "observability blueprints for dev teams" = needs single standard. Native OTel support aligns with standardization push.
* Why ANYTHING: 99.999% uptime target for financial services. 100+ microservices across multiple clusters = incident correlation complexity. Platform Engineering IDP initiative needs unified observability layer to reduce MTTR.
* Data Freshness: HIGH
