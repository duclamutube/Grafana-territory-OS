- Tier: 1
- Status: Active sequence
- Outreach Start: 2026-01-15
- Revisit: 2026-03-01

- Signals: SRE hiring Denver (Jan 2026) | $125M tariff pressure | New CIO 22mo + CTO 20mo | 6 warm leads with trials
- Why NOW: New CIO + CTO need transformation wins. $125M tariff pressure demands consolidation math. 8 months since deal lost = budget cycle reset.
- Why NOW Source: ChatAE Jan 2026, Gong May 2025
- Why GRAFANA: 6 overlapping tools (Splunk, Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Azure Monitor x2). Self-host preference. Champion quote: "unlocking features we know we want."
- Why GRAFANA Source: ChatAE Jan 2026, Gong May 2025
- Why ANYTHING: IoT platform (PowerInsights) scaling faster than team capacity. "Net zero for leadership" = needs savings math. Device telemetry = high-cardinality metrics.

- Signals: Chris Rottinger 130 hrs + pricing page | Ryand McGuire NetFlow docs (Jan 8) | 15 contacts with behavioral data | Multiple pricing views
- Why NOW: 15 contacts actively researching. Pricing page views = evaluation mode. Platform team scaling with microservices migration.

### Cision
- Score: 88
- Tier: 1
- Status: Warm emails sent

- Signals: NEW team evaluating (not 2023 people) | Kamlesh 36 pages k6/Loki | Sunil 7 hrs Cloud trial | Staff SRE hiring
- Why NOW: Different team than 2023 closed-lost = no baggage. Activity within 7 days. OSS approach shifted to Cloud trial evaluation.
- Why NOW Source: CSV Jan 2026
- Why GRAFANA: OSS Loki migration FAILED - still Elasticsearch 5/5 after 14 months. Successfully exited Datadog (now 1/5) = proves they CAN migrate.
- Why GRAFANA Source: Gong Nov 2023 (hypothesis), HG Data Jan 2026 (validation)
- Why ANYTHING: Wanted to "go all in" on Grafana stack (Loki + Mimir). 99.5% uptime SLA commitment. Staff SRE hiring = scaling team.
- Why ANYTHING Source: Gong Nov 2023, ChatAE Jan 2026
- Outcome: SLA compliance (99.5% uptime) + Staff SRE time on reliability not infrastructure + Elastic migration unblocked
- Data Freshness: MEDIUM

- Why NOW Source: CSV Jan 2026, Gong Feb-Sep 2025

- Why ANYTHING: "Next two phases is ServiceNow integration and Splunk integration." Platform Engineering hiring. Incident Command Center with MTTR tracking.
- Why ANYTHING Source: Gong Jul 2025, ChatAE Jan 2026
- Outcome: Single pane across Splunk/ServiceNow + MTTR improvement (ICC tracking) + firewall blocker bypassed via Cloud
- Data Freshness: MEDIUM

### ActiveCampaign

- Outcome: Cloud-only features (AI/ML forecasting) + operational overhead eliminated + proven 73% savings extended
- Data Freshness: MEDIUM
- Data Warning: Blog/Gong 24-35 months old. BUT: Current behavior (Jan 2026) validates continued interest. 73% is their own published claim.
- Top Contacts: Gladson George (Dir Platform Eng, authored blog) | Sukanya Sengupta (Cloud-only research) | Shawn Saavedra (Sr SRE Mgr)
- Competitive: Datadog 2/5, New Relic 2/5, Opsgenie - still paying for overlap
