- Angle: New CIO/CTO need transformation wins - 6 tools creating context-switching during incidents
- Signals: SRE hiring (Jan 2026) | New CIO 22mo + CTO 20mo | $125M tariff pressure
- Why NOW: New CIO (22mo) + CTO (20mo) need transformation wins. $125M tariff pressure demands consolidation math. SRE hiring shows capacity gap. Budget cycle reset (8mo since deal lost).
- Why NOW Source: ChatAE Jan 2026, Gong May 2025
- Why GRAFANA: 6 overlapping tools (Splunk, Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Azure Monitor x2) = engineers context-switch during incidents. Self-host preference. Champion: "unlocking features we know we want."
- Why GRAFANA Source: ChatAE Jan 2026, Gong May 2025, HG Data
- Why ANYTHING: IoT platform (PowerInsights) scaling faster than team capacity. Device telemetry = high-cardinality metrics. "Net zero for leadership" = need savings math. Data hire tabled.

- Signals: Chris Rottinger 130 hrs + pricing (Jan 2026) | Ryand McGuire NetFlow docs (Jan 8) | Calista 151 hrs

- Why NOW Source: CSV Jan 2026, ChatAE Jan 2026
- Why GRAFANA: Existing customer ($18K ARR, k6 only). Datadog 2/5 = low switching friction. Datadog confirmed "expensive."
- Why GRAFANA Source: CRM + HG Data Jan 2026, Gong Nov 2025
- Why ANYTHING: Microservices migration (monolith to microservices) creating distributed systems complexity. Platform Engineering team managing K8s, CI/CD, logging. CIO build culture.

- Why NOW Source: CSV Jan 2026
- Why GRAFANA: OSS Loki migration FAILED after 14 months - still Elasticsearch 5/5. Cloud solves operational burden. Successfully exited Datadog (now 1/5) = proves they CAN migrate.
- Why GRAFANA Source: Gong Nov 2023, HG Data Jan 2026 (validates)
- Why ANYTHING: Wanted to "go all in" on Grafana stack. 99.5% uptime SLA commitment. Staff SRE hiring = scaling team.

- Why ANYTHING: "Next two phases is ServiceNow integration and Splunk integration." Incident Command Center with MTTR tracking.
- Why ANYTHING Source: Gong Jul 2025, ChatAE Jan 2026
